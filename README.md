## Method Evaluation 

#### A decision on the techologies to be used:

- It seemed that a Javascript based application would be the best way forward. The reasons for this were twofold: firstly, it would be easier to handle the data between the frontend and backend using Nodejs in concurrence with Reactjs. Furthermore, these were web technologies that I was most familiar with.   

#### Prioritisation of the steps towards completing the task:

- An outline of the course of action, by following the agile iterative approach, is central to the project outcome. Most important element: set up Nodejs development environment by creating a SQLite3 database to store the data objects from the sqldump file, and then display this on the client side with Reactjs. An advantage of SQLite3 is that it serves as a stand alone database that does not require a full client-server environment: this is ideal for small projects with a small amount of data. Template literals can then be constructed to pass in the movie data properties from the associated api. 

- The next stage of the development cycle is to add the option for users to add or remove the list of favourite movies. This can be done using vanilla javascript DOM manipulation. 

- The final step of least concern are the bonus tasks of the assignment. These include adding user authentication (login system) and deploying the application to Heroku.
