## The task
- Build a webserver with PHP (Apache or Nginx as webserver) or JavaScript (NodeJs as webserver) as the server side language
- Use MySQL, MariaDB, PostgreSQL, SQL Server or SQLite as the database
- Using framework such as AngularJS, Angular, ReactJS, Vue, etc. is a plus but not necesssary

## Expectations
Make a copy of this repo. Solve the task below. Push your code to a public repo, and send us the link as a reply to our email.

Your solution should include a short readme describing your technology choice, your solution, how to use/test it and any final considerations such as known errors, limitation, something you struggle with, next steps, security concerns etc. Donâ€™t worry we are not expecting this thing to be perfect.
